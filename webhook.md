# Webhooks

Webhooks make it super easy to build on top of Qiscus SDK. They are
user-defined callbacks. They are triggered by events -- in this case, messages
from customers and businesses. When the event occurs, the webhook will
make a http(s) call to the URI itâ€™s configured to.

## On Post Message

Webhooks on post message being triggered either from sdk client side or
from REST API

PROTOCOL : HTTPS
VERB : POST

payload being send to your endpoint is below

```json
{
    "type": "post_comment_mobile", // either type "post_comment_mobile" if from client side or "post_comment_rest" if from REST API
    "payload": {
        "from": {
            "id": 1,
            "email": "user1@gmail.com",
            "name": "User1",
        },
        "room": {
            "id": 1,

            "name": "ini grup",
            "participants": [
